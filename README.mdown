## About

Use this program at your own risk. It WILL crash your computer (even as a non-root user) and cause data loss.

I created this program (based on sysfuzz and customized for snow leopard) while I was in school for a course on security. It was used to find several kernel level exploits for a presentation, including an integer underflow.

Use it at your own risk.
